This repository demonstrates a common Python error: forgetting to close parentheses in a function definition. The bug.py file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.py provides the corrected version.  The error results in a SyntaxError because the interpreter cannot parse the code correctly.  The solution is straightforward: ensure all opening parentheses have corresponding closing parentheses.
